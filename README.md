## Food Order Application

A recreation of the food-ordering application used at Burger King counters, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the practical use of web technologies to design, style, and implement an interactive ordering system.

### Overview
This project is inspired by the food-ordering system, I interact with daily as a part-time employee at Burger King. The goal is to recreate the application's functionality, design, and providing an interactive experience. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of my skills in front-end web development.

### Static Website hosting using AWS S3 bucket
To enhance accessibility and ensure the application is publicly available, I utilized AWS S3 to host the project. All project assets, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data files, were uploaded to an S3 bucket. Static website hosting was enabled on the bucket, providing a seamless way to access the application online.
